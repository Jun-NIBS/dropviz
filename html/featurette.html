	    <p><a href="http://mccarrolllab.com/dropseq/">Drop-seq</a> is a technology we developed for highly parallel analysis of RNA expression in thousands of individual cells.  Drop-seq works by encapsulating individual cells into vast numbers of nanoliter-sized droplets, together with DNA-barcoded beads that uniquely identify the droplets.  We described Drop-seq in <a href="http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00549-8">a paper in 2015</a>, and subsequent commercial technologies have been built on this approach. We have made Drop-seq open-source, and hundreds of labs have adopted it; detailed protocols and software are available on the <a href="http://mccarrolllab.com/dropseq/">Drop-seq web site</a>.</p>

	    <p>
	      The mammalian brain is composed of a large, unknown
number of specialized cell types whose complex interactions drive
behavior. Unbiased, large-scale gene expression profiling in
individual cells offers an opportunity to systematically characterize
cellular specialization within the nervous system. We used
Drop-seq<sup>1</sup>, which enables unbiased assessment of gene
expression from thousands of individual cells, to generate profiles
from 690,000 cells in nine tissues of the adult mouse brain: frontal
cortex (156,000), posterior cortex (99,000), striatum (77,000),
cerebellum (26,000), hippocampus (113,000), substantia nigra/ventral
tegmental area (44,000), globus pallidus externus/nucleus basalis
(66,000), thalamus (89,000), and entopeduncular nucleus (19,000). To
identify distinct patterns of co-expression, we performed independent
component analysis (ICA) on each of the nine individual tissue
datasets. ICA identified both biologically derived signals—including
those corresponding to canonical cell type distinctions and those with
spatially graded patterns—as well as to technical signals—including
those that were highly replicate-dependent, defined cell "doublets",
or were correlated with tissue processing. We retained 601
non-technical ICs for use in graph-based clustering<sup>2</sup>,
partitioning cells into 565 distinct groups. These populations
encompassed all known major cell classes in the nervous system,
including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and
polydendrocytes, endothelial cells, and cells of the choroid plexus.
Our analysis uncovers numerous undescribed cell types and states
across the nervous system.
