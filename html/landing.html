        <p class="lead">We sequenced 1.45 billion transcripts in 690,000 individual cells from nine different regions of the adult mouse brain using Drop-Seq, a highly parallelized, single-cell, genome-wide transcript counting method (link). This public data set provides insight into the major transcriptional signatures of all brain cell classes. Additionally, our data identify within-class cell types and subtypes. Drop-Viz allows users to search for cell types associated with a gene of interest and to identify gene sets that are differentially expressed in neuronal regions, cell classes and cell types.</p>
