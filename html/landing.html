        <p class="lead">We sequenced 1.3 billion transcripts in 500,000 individual cells in nine different regions of the mouse brain using Drop-Seq technology&mdash;a highly parallelized, genome-wide method using droplets. (I just made those numbers up.) This public data set provides new insight into the gene signatures of known brain cell types and novel cell sub-types showing distinct expression profiles. The data provides an unprecedented ability to search for cell types associated with gene of interest and to identify gene sets that are differentially expressed in neuronal regions, cell classes and cell types.</p>
